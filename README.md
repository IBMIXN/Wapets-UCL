# Wapets (UCL - IBM Collaboration)
## MSc Computer Science Dissertation project
by Natalia del Mar


This is a project developed as part of the UCL IXN - Industry Exchange Network for IBM. It is an explorative application that uses IBM Watson services too understand the potential benefits of conversational pets on the health of the elder.

## Context
Loneliness and social isolation are severe common problems in the elder generations. Web application like social media messaging and video platforms have demonstrated to be beneficial for the mental health of the elder, increasing their feeling of mattering, their mood and their social engagement with the outer world. However, elder generations have a gap of experience with mobile and portable IT devices, as well as with web applications.

Aditionally, attempts to mitigate loneliness and social isolation, and their negative effects in the health of the elder have been achieved successfully with the use of robotic pets. They create an emotional bonding with the owner and become their playful friends, just like a real pet. Similarly, conversational agents have proved to also receive positive results on loneliness and social isolation in elder users. 

**The opportunity of using AI technologies to create conversational pets to interact with elder users, exploiting the benefits seen in both robotic pets and conversational agents, and fill this way the technological gap of the elder, allowing them to access the benefits of the Web, is worth exploring.** An explorative model needs to be developed to understand the viability and effectiveness of a system that combines AI for the use of web applications for the benefit of the elder and their health. 

Wapets is an explorative model developed in Node-RED that uses IBM Watson Assistant services to create a multichatbot conversational system for the elder to use. It has a simple interface with which the user can talk and listen to the answer of the pets. The pets are ready to handle basic requests like greetings, but also more advanced requests like sending and receiving private messages via Facebook Messenger and browsing videos online in YouTube. The idea is to provide the elder with company, but also to be an intuitive gateway to the outside world.
